## 
This repository contains examples demonstrating how a service can integrate with EtherJolt's smart contracts to retrive payment records which can be use to authenticate incoming user wallet connections. 

These examples feature viem, a light weight javascript library for connecting and interacting with the user's wallet. 
However, this process can be integrated with any library that enables applications to execute a request to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to read a smart contract.

See exmaple directories for more details.
